# Intro

This project is a remake of the REST Countries project form FE Mentor.
I made that project on 2021 as part of my portfolio,  but now in 2023 I have decided to redo it, using different and better technologies that I have learned along the way.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech

- This is a React based project using Typescript.
- Using RTKQuery to fetch and handle data from an external API. The main reason to do so is data caching, as this project would involve otherwise an unnecessary amount of API calls that can be reduced by using this.
- Tailwind as CSS framework make it beautiful and lighweight without spending a lot of time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Why

Building this out of motivation to practice RTKQuery, project file structure and tailwind on already known grounds.
As a cutiosity, the first project took me 8-10 hours of work, while this one has taken me XX hours, which is a good measue bar for me to see how my skills have improved.
